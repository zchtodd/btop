Server process monitoring viewable within a web browser.

Btop takes inspiration from the htop resource monitor.  The goal is to take the detailed overview of htop and provide the same in a 
web based format that can be viewed locally or remotely.

# Installation

    pip install .
    
# Usage

    btop-run.py

Executing the ```btop-run.py``` script will launch the monitor process as well as your default browser.

The newly opened browser tab should navigate to the btop page and start showing process information.
